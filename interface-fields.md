Interface fields
================

As an interface is not instantiable, it may not contain data on a per
instance basis. It is though allowable to define static fields in an
interface. These are equivalent to static fields in a class: they exist
exactly once regardless of how many instances there are of classes that
implement the interface.

The syntax for static interface fields is the same as the static class
fields: See [Classes/Class
fields](http://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Vala/Manual/Export/Vala/Manual/Classes#Class_fields)
. For more explanation of static vs instance members, see [Classes/Types
of class
members](http://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Vala/Manual/Export/Vala/Manual/Classes#Types_of_class_members)
.
