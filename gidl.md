GIDL metadata format
--------------------

This section describes the format of .metadata files as used by *vapigen* as additional information for .vapi file generation. Some of the information specified in the metadata can be used to set [symbol attributes](http://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Vala/Manual/Export/Projects/Vala/Manual/Attributes#) as well.
