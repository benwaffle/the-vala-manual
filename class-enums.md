Class enums
===========

Enums defined in a class are basically the same as those defined in a namespace. The only difference is the scope and the choice of visibilities available. See [Enumerated types (Enums)](enums.md).

-   class-enum-declaration:

    -   [ class-member-visibility-modifier ] **enum** enum-name **{** [ enum-members ] **}**
