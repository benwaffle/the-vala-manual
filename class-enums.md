Class enums
===========

Enums defined in a class are basically the same as those defined in a namespace. The only difference is the scope and the choice of visibilities available. See [Enumerated types (Enums)](http://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Vala/Manual/Export/Vala/Manual/Enumerated%20types%20%28Enums%29#).
