Other interface members
=======================

Constants, Enums, Delegates and Inner Classes all function the same as when they are declared in a class. See [Classes](classes.md). When declared in an interface, all these members can be accessed either using the name of the interface (that is, of the static interface scope), or through and instance of an implementing class.
