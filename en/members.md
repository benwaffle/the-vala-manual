Members
=======

Namespaces members exist in the namespace's scope. They fall into two broad categories: data and definitions. Data members are fields which contain type instances. Definitions are things that can be invoked or instantiated. Namespace members can be declared either private or public. Public data can be accessed from anywhere, whilst private data can only be accessed from inside the namespace. Public definitions are visible to code defined in a different namespace, and thus can be invoked or instantiated from anywhere, private definitions are only visible to code inside the namespace, and so can only be invoked or instantiated from there.

-   access-modifier:

    -   **public**

    -   **internal**

    -   **private**

For the types of namespace members that are not described on this page see [Classes](classes.md), [Structs](structs.md),[Delegates](delegates.md),[Enumerated types(Enums)](enums.md), and [Enumerated types (Enums)/Error domains](error-domains.md).
