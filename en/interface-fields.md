Interface fields
================

As an interface is not instantiable, it may not contain data on a per instance basis. It is though allowable to define static fields in an interface. These are equivalent to static fields in a class: they exist exactly once regardless of how many instances there are of classes that implement the interface.

The syntax for static interface fields is the same as the static class fields: See [Classes/Class fields](class-fields.md). For more explanation of static vs instance members, see [Classes/Types of class members](types_of_class_members.md).
