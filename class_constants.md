Class constants
===============

Constants defined in a class are basically the same as those defined in a namespace. The only difference is the scope and the choice of visibilities available.

-   class-constant-declaration:

    -   [ class-member-visibility-modifier ] **const** qualified-type-name constant-name **=** expression ;
