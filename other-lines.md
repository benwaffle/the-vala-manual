Other Lines
===========

Every non-comment line in the file is made of up two sections: the
specifier, and the parameters.

The specifier is the first text to appear on the line, and it specifies
what the rest of the line will be modifying.

The parameters are a space separated list of a parameter name, followed
by an equals sign and the value enclosed in quotes.

For example, this line sets *parameter1* and *parameter2* on *foo.bar* :

    foo.bar parameter1="value" parameter2="value"

</div>
