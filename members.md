Members
=======

Namespaces members exist in the namespace's scope. They fall into two
broad categories: data and definitions. Data members are fields which
contain type instances. Definitions are things that can be invoked or
instantiated. Namespace members can be declared either private or
public. Public data can be accessed from anywhere, whilst private data
can only be accessed from inside the namespace. Public definitions are
visible to code defined in a different namespace, and thus can be
invoked or instantiated from anywhere, private definitions are only
visible to code inside the namespace, and so can only be invoked or
instantiated from there.
