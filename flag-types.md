Flag types
==========

An enumerated type declaration can be converted into a flag type declaration by annotating the declaration with "Flags". A flag type represents a set of flags, any number of which can be combined in one instance of the flag type, in the same fashion as a bitfield in C. For an explanation of the operations that can be performed on flag types,
see [Expressions/Flag operations](http://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Vala/Manual/Export/Vala/Manual/Expressions#Flag_operations)
