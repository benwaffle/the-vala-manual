Try statement
=============

The try statement provides a mechanism for catching exceptions that occur during execution of a block. Furthermore, the try statement provides the ability to specify a block of code that is always executed when control leaves the try statement.

For the syntax of the try statement, See [Errors/Error catching](http://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Vala/Manual/Export/Vala/Manual/Errors#Error_catching)
