Parameterised types
===================

TODO: Casting.

Vala allows definitions of types that can be customised at runtime with
type parameters. For example, a list can be defined so that it can be
instantiated as a list of ints, a list of Objects, etc. This is achieved
using generic declarations. See
[Generics](http://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Vala/Manual/Export/Projects/Vala/Manual/Generics#)
.
