Fields
======

Variables that exist directly in a namespace are known as namespace fields. These exist only once, and within the scope of the namespace which exists for the application's entire run time. They are therefore similar to global variables in C but without the risk of naming clashes.

-   field-declaration:

    -   [ access-modifier ] qualified-type-name field-name [ **=**
        expression ] ;

    field-name:

    -   identifier

Fields in general are described at [Concepts/Variables, fields and parameters](http://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Vala/Manual/Export/Vala/Manual/Concepts#Variables,_fields_and_parameters)
