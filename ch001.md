Overview
--------

Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern language
features to GNOME developers without imposing any additional runtime
requirements and without using a different ABI than applications and
libraries written in C. It provides a concise way of using GLib and
GObject features, but does not attempt to expose all possibilities. In
particular, Vala is primarily a statically typed language - this is a
design decision, not an oversight.

The only support that Vala applications require at runtime are the
standard GLib and GObject libraries. It is possible to use any system
library from Vala, provided that a VAPI file is written to describe the
interface - Vala is distributed with VAPI descriptions of most libraries
commonly used by GNOME applications, and many others as well.

Vala provides easy integration with DBus, by automatically writing
boiler plate code where required, for exposing objects, dispatching
methods, etc.
